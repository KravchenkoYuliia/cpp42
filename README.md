## Introduction

> C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an ex-
tension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes" (source: Wikipedia).


> The goal of these modules is to introduce you to Object-Oriented Programming.
This will be the starting point of your C++ journey. Many languages are recommended
for learning OOP. We decided to choose C++ since it’s derived from your old friend C.
Since C++ is a complex language, and in order to keep things simple, your code will
follow the C++98 standard.

> We are aware modern C++ is way different in a lot of aspects. So if you want to
become a proficient C++ developer, it’s up to you to go further after the 42 Common
Core!

> You will discover new concepts step-by-step. The exercises will progressively increase
in complexity (source: 42 School subject).
