## STL (Standart Template Library)
	Parts of STL:
		- containers that are used to store the data
		- algorithms that are used to process the data
		- functors that are used to write custom algorithms
		- iterators that are used to navigate through the data


## Containers
	avalable in Standard Template Library(STL) as the objects of the class templates
	ex: vector(automatically resizable dynamic array), array(fixed size), stack, queue, map ...

	    CONTAINERS		DATA TYPES
	    array:		~arrays(static)
	    vector:		~arrays(dynamic) #include <vector> 
	    queue:		~queue
	    stack:		~stack
	    priority_queue:	~heaps
	    list:		~linked list
	    set:		~trees
	    map:		~arrays

## Iterators
	an object that behaves like a pointer to traverse and access elements of a container.
	    
## Algorithms
	ready-made functions that help you perform common operations like searching, sorting, counting, and comparing on containers. #include <algorithm>
