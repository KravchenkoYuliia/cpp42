# std::stack
	#include <stack> 
Stacks are a type of container adaptor, specifically designed to operate in a LIFO context (last-in first-out), where elements are inserted and extracted only from one end of the container. 

Elements are pushed/popped from the "back" of the specific container, which is known as the top of the stack.



## std::stack::push
	Inserts a new element at the top of the stack, above its current top element.

## std::stack::pop
	Removes the element on top of the stack, effectively reducing its size by one.
